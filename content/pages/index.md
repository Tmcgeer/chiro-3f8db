        subtitle: >-
          Many athletes both professionals and amateurs choose to go for
          chiropractic care. This is because Chiropractic can improve range of
          motion, reduce pain, decrease recovery time, assist in injury repair
          and lead to overall optimal wellness.

          The treatment I received from Dr. Gert Cloete was amazing. I managed
          to run the last stage of the Dryland Traverse after missing both the
          first and second stages due to calf injury. Dr. Gert had all his
          equipment at the race, and I was surprised to see the passion he had
          for his job. I won’t ever hesitate to refer anybody to him.

          Working with Alyvia was great because she was well versed in all of
          our tools and applications, and was able to manage our store and
          campaigns without any technical glitches.
