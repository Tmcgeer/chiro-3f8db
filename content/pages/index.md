      - title: Why should Athletes see a Chiropractor?
        subtitle: >-
          Many athletes both professionals and amateurs choose to go for
          chiropractic care. This is because Chiropractic can improve range of
          motion, reduce pain, decrease recovery time, assist in injury repair
          and lead to overall optimal wellness.

      The treatment I received from Dr. Gert Cloete was amazing. I managed to
      run the last stage of the Dryland Traverse after missing both the first
      and second stages due to calf injury. Dr. Gert had all his equipment at
      the race, and I was surprised to see the passion he had for his job. I
      won’t ever hesitate to refer anybody to him.
