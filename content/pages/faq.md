      - title: What can you expect during your first chiropractic adjustment?
        content: >
          Chiropractor’s focus is to firstly evaluate the biomechanical
          structure of the spine. Upon evaluation the chiropractor will ensure
          that each individual vertebra is able to move in its normal range of
          motion. This is done through various techniques of careful
          manipulation, ‘adjustment’. This process involves high velocity, low
          amplitude thrust, (a non-invasive treatment) with the goal of
          relieving patients of any pain, stiffness or weakness in the body.
          Many people associate a ‘popping’ or ‘cracking’ noise with a
          chiropractic adjustment, this can result in people being hesitant in
          visiting a chiropractor. However, this is normal and is known as a
          ‘cavitation’. All joints in the body are lined with synovial fluid,
          which acts as a form of lubrication. During a cavitation, this will
          result in the release of gases from the joints within your spine,
          providing patients with a sense of relief. Chiropractic adjustments
          have been proven to be medically safe and effective in nature.
      - title: Is Chiropractic Care for All Ages?
        content: >
          Chiropractors focus on using non-invasive treatment options that are
          effective for all stages of life. Chiropractors can assist pregnant
          women in their different stages of pregnancy, ensuring correct pelvic
          balance, which creates room for the baby during foetal development.
          Many women experience back pain during pregnancy, this pain can be
          relieved through chiropractic treatment, ensuring a smooth delivery
          process. During the birthing process, certain procedures occur which
          cause subluxation. This as well as other common conditions such as
          colic, sleeping problems, fussiness etc, can be alleviated through
          chiropractic treatment. Toddlers enter phases of learning
          co-ordination, which results in stress being placed on their muscles
          and joints, it is imperative that they receive treatment that supports
          their small bodies. Common conditions such as sports injuries,
          headaches, neck pain, muscle pain, back pain, and poor posture can be
          experienced by young adolescents. Chiropractic care can help with
          relieving these various forms of pain and allowing optimal day to day
          function. Chiropractic treatment can be instrumental in helping
          seniors eliminate pain, improve flexibility, increase strength and
          enhance balance. Chiropractic adjustments will also improve the
          overall health and range of motion, leading to an active lifestyle in
          years of elderliness.

          Can Chiropractic Care help with the postural pain I experience at my
          office job?
        content: >
          In today’s intensely driven workforce, many people are forced to work
          from their desks and laptops for long periods of time. Factors such as
          poor posture and sitting for too long are two of the leading causes of
          chiropractors seeing an increase in patients who are facing serious
          spinal problems, headaches, neck pain, tightness in the trapezius area
          and many more symptoms. The human body was not created for such
          strenuous activities, creating room for serious long term damage.
          However, chiropractic treatment reduces and eliminates these symptoms
          and places the body back into the correct alignment, providing relief
          to many patients, as the excessive pressure placed on nerves in the
          body can be relieved. Adjustment allows the body to function
          optimally, removing excess pressure from the musculoskeletal system.

        content: >
          Many athletes both professionals and amateurs choose to go for
          chiropractic care. This is because Chiropractic can improve range of
          motion, reduce pain, decrease recovery time, assist in injury repair
          and lead to overall optimal wellness. At Cloete Chiropractic we have
