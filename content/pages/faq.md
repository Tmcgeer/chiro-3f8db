      - title: How do you base your pricing?
        content: >-
          Depending on the scope and timeline of your content needs, we can work
          on a retainer basis, an hour bank, or a per-project basis. Once I
          understand your needs I will create a tailored proposal with several
          options to choose from.
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.

        content: >-

          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
